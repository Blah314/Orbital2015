Notes on level format:

Each level occupies one line, with the line having at least 10 parameters. 
(Add more if we make it more complicated)

0 - LevelID (Used to lookup the level chosen)
1 - LevelSet (Used to indicate which campaign a level belongs in)
2 - LevelName (The name displayed to the player)
3 - Objective (What needs to be done to complete the level:
	0 - Eliminate everybody
	1 - Capture X territories
	2 - Survive X turns
	3 - Eliminate everybody in X turns or less)
	(More can be added)
4 - ObjectiveNum (Replaces the X for game modes 1,2,3)
5 - NumPlayers (We need NumPlayers - 1 AI players)
6 - Description (Level description seen by the player)
