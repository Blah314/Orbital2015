        <item>Hello and welcome to Orbit Wars! This instructions page will contain all the info you will need to learn how to play the game.\n\n
            Orbit Wars is a Risk-like turn-based 4X game, where you control a faction and have to complete certain objectives to acheive victory. If you have played Risk before, gameplay should come naturally to you.\n\n
            Read on for more detailed information. Or simply learn as you play!</item>
        <item>The most basic objective in Orbit Wars is to eliminate all your opponents, represented by other factions in different colours on the map.\n\n
            To do that, you have to buy armies with your resources and conquer all their territories. The territories you hold at the start of each turn will grant you resources automatically, so defend them if you want to keep your income going.\n\n
            Clicking on any of your territories on the map will bring up another menu, where you can perform various actions with regard to that territory. This can range from adding armies to attacking neighbouring territories.\n\n
            Once you are done with your turn, press the end turn button. The AI player(s) will then take their turns and then play passes back to you. (If you are still alive at the end of their wrath.)</item>
        <item>An Orbit Wars game is highly customisable, allowing you to choose which mechanics you want active and which you don\'t. This is done via the Game Customisation screen shown after selecting a level.\n\n
            A detailed description of each modifier can be found below:\n\n
            Difficulty: Determines the general difficulty of the AI players.\n\n
            Dice-Like: As with Risk, you can choose to have the outcomes of battles be determined by dice-rolls, adding a factor of luck into a battle. Battles are one-for-one by default.</item>
