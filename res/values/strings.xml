        <item>Hello and welcome to Orbit Wars! This instructions page will contain all the info you will need to learn how to play the game.\n\n
            Orbit Wars is a Risk-like turn-based 4X game, where you control a faction and have to complete certain objectives to acheive victory. If you have played Risk before, gameplay should come naturally to you.\n\n
            Read on for more detailed information. Or simply learn as you play!</item>
        <item>The most basic objective in Orbit Wars is to eliminate all your opponents, represented by other factions in different colours on the map. Your faction is blue on the map.\n\n
            To do that, you have to buy armies with your resources and conquer all their territories. The territories you hold at the start of each turn will grant you resources automatically, so defend them if you want to keep your income going.\n\n
            Clicking on any of your territories on the map will bring up another menu, where you can perform various actions with regard to that territory. This can range from adding armies to attacking neighbouring territories.\n\n
            Once you are done with your turn, press the end turn button. The AI player(s) will then take their turns and then play passes back to you. (If you are still alive at the end of their wrath.)\n\n
            If you want to know what happened in detail, check the game log.</item>
        <item>An Orbit Wars game is highly customisable, allowing you to choose which mechanics you want active and which you don\'t. This is done via the Game Customisation screen shown after selecting a level.\n\n
            A detailed description of each modifier can be found below:\n\n
            Difficulty: Determines the general difficulty of the AI players. Play higher difficulties to earn better medals for the level.\n\n
            Dice-Like: As with Risk, you can choose to have the outcomes of battles be determined by dice-rolls, adding a factor of luck into a battle. Battles are one-for-one by default.\n\n
            Capital Cities: One of your starting territories will be your capital. Lose it, and you lose the game. Same goes for your opponents. Capitals can be identified by asterisks on both sides of their name on the map.\n\n
            Upgrades: Enabling this will allow you to spend resources to upgrade your territories or armies.\n\n
            Fog Of War: To make things super realistic, where you can\'t see what\'s happening beyond your borders, turn this on.\n\n
            Hardcore Mode: Your game is not saved in this mode. So no going back once you have left. Can you handle it?</item>

	<string name="totd">Quick Tip</string>
	<string-array name="tips">
        <item>To see what your opponents have done on previous turns, check the log!</item>
        <item>Some customisations can make a level much easier or much harder.</item>
        <item>Replay levels on harder difficulties to earn better medals for that level.</item>
        <item>Sometimes it\'s best to allow your enemies to fight each other.</item>
        <item>Quickly wiping out someone will lessen the cost of the fight, but may pass the advantage to another opponent.</item>
        <item>You need more territories to gain more resources, but that only works if you can keep hold of them.</item>
        <item>Look for weak spots in the enemy front lines. That may distract them from their main assault.</item>
        <item>Upgrades are mostly useful for long games.</item>
        <item>Holding regions can be key to winning, despite a lower number of territories.</item>
        <item>Sometimes it\'s best to just focus on your objective and nothing else.</item>
        <item>Capitals can work both ways, you can terminate an otherwise indominatable opponent, or a smaller faction can unceremoniously kill you.</item>
        <item>When playing with dice-like results, the defender has an advantage.</item>
        <item>For some of the harder levels, it can all boil down to luck.</item>
        <item>Capitals and certain territories are worth more resources per turn.</item>
        <item>On higher difficulties, the AI is brutal, but you\'re smarter. Right?</item>
        <item>Utilise chokepoints to limit your opoonents\' possible attacks.</item>
        <item>When no one is near, conquer territories as fast as possible.</item>
        <item>Expanding quickly but leaving newly conquered areas poorly defended is risky.</item>
        <item>You can see how much a territory is worth per turn on the bottom-right of the territory menu.</item>
        <item>Plan ahead. Place your armies where they are needed most.</item>
        <item>Take a break every once in a while. Your game saves automatically. (Unless you\'re hardcore.)</item>
        <item>Saving resources is good sometimes.</item>
        <item>Some neutral territories are just not worth conquering.</item>
        <item>Enable fog-of-war for a reality check.</item>
        <item>You can see the region each territory belongs to via the action bar when viewing a territory.</item>
